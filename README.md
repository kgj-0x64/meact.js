# Advanced React

## Objective

The objective here is to go well beyond syntax land or basics and to compile theory, techniques and tools to level up my game as a React developer from "get shit done" to "that guy Reacts".

## Acknowledgement

I am just the final editor here, these are notes and I do not mean to claim any authority over phrases/content or infringe any copyrights. I have heavily borrowed from MDN/React.js docs and spent many hours on search and asking questions to ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini, and editing them into this form. And most importantly, I was very inspired by _Nadia Makarevich's_ book "Advanced React" which gave me a clean list of topics to pursue, if not the lessons themselves.
