# WHAT's MISSING

Beyond many for-scale things, these necessary ones:

- Great documentation and OSS community
- Even better declarative syntax
- Local development server and hot reload
- Devtools and dev/prod environments
- Scoped CSS; CSS-in-JS
- Cross-browser tested API
- Ecosystem of client or async state management, UI components, caching, etc
- Ecosystem of build, bundler and tree-shaking tools
- Concurrent rendering
- Server side rendering
- Performance optimizations:
  - The virtual DOM allows React to batch updates and minimize direct manipulation of the real DOM, making the UI faster and more efficient.
