      <b>Welcome to Hacker News</b>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        <a href="/">Hacker News</a> is a bit different from other community
        sites, and we&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d take a minute to read the
        following as well as the{" "}
        <a href="/newsguidelines">official guidelines</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        HN is an experiment. As a rule, a community site that becomes popular
        will decline in quality. Our hypothesis is that this is not
        inevitable—that by making a conscious effort to resist decline, we can
        keep it from happening.
      </p>
      <p>
        Essentially there are two rules here: don&#39;t post or upvote crap
        links, and don&#39;t be rude or dumb in comment threads.
      </p>
      <p>
        A crap link is one that&#39;s only superficially interesting. Stories on
        HN don&#39;t have to be about hacking, because good hackers aren&#39;t
        only interested in hacking, but they do have to be deeply interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        What does &quot;deeply interesting&quot; mean? It means stuff that
        teaches you about the world. A story about a robbery, for example, would
        probably not be deeply interesting. But if this robbery was a sign of
        some bigger, underlying trend, perhaps it could be.
      </p>
      <p>
        The worst thing to post or upvote is something that&#39;s intensely but
        shallowly interesting: gossip about famous people, funny or cute
        pictures or videos, partisan political articles, etc. If you let{" "}
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_perch">
          that sort of thing onto a news site, it will push aside the deeply
          interesting stuff, which tends to be quieter.
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important principle on HN, though, is to make thoughtful
        comments. Thoughtful in both senses: civil and substantial.
      </p>
      <p>
        The test for substance is a lot like it is for links. Does your comment
        teach us anything? There are two ways to do that: by pointing out some
        consideration that hadn&#39;t previously been mentioned, and by giving
        more information about the topic, perhaps from personal experience.
        Whereas comments like &quot;LOL!&quot; or worse still, &quot;That&#39;s
        retarded!&quot; teach us nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Empty comments can be ok if they&#39;re positive. There&#39;s nothing
        wrong with submitting a comment saying just &quot;Thanks.&quot; What we
        especially discourage are comments that are empty and negative—comments
        that are mere name-calling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which brings us to the most important principle on HN: civility. Since
        long before the web, the anonymity of online conversation has lured
        people into being much ruder than they&#39;d be in person. So the
        principle here is: don&#39;t say anything you wouldn&#39;t say face to
        face. This doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t disagree. But disagree without
        calling names. If you&#39;re right, your argument will be more
        convincing without them.
