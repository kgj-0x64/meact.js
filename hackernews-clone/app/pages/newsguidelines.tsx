      <b>Hacker News Guidelines</b>
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>What to Submit</b>
      <p>
        On-Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That
        includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a
        sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one&#39;s
        intellectual curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless
        they&#39;re evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Ideological or
        political battle or talking points. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or
        cute animal pictures. If they&#39;d cover it on TV news, it&#39;s
        probably off-topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>In Submissions</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Please don&#39;t do things to make titles stand out, like using
        uppercase or exclamation points, or adding a parenthetical remark saying
        how great an article is. It&#39;s implicit in submitting something that
        you think it&#39;s important.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you submit a link to a video or pdf, please warn us by appending
        [video] or [pdf] to the title.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please submit the original source. If a post reports on something found
        on another site, submit the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the original title includes the name of the site, please take it out,
        because the site name will be displayed after the link.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the original title begins with a number or number + gratuitous
        adjective, we&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d crop it. E.g. translate
        &quot;10 Ways To Do X&quot; to &quot;How To Do X,&quot; and &quot;14
        Amazing Ys&quot; to &quot;Ys.&quot; Exception: when the number is
        meaningful, e.g. &quot;The 5 Platonic Solids.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise please use the original title, unless it is misleading or
        linkbait.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please don&#39;t post on HN to ask or tell us something. Instead, please
        send it to hn@ycombinator.com. Similarly, please don&#39;t use HN posts
        to ask YC-funded companies questions that you could ask by emailing
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please don&#39;t submit so many links at once that the new page is
        dominated by your submissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>In Comments</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Be civil. Don&#39;t say things you wouldn&#39;t say face-to-face.
        Don&#39;t be snarky. Comments should get more civil and substantive, not
        less, as a topic gets more divisive.
      </p>
      <p>
        When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names.
        &quot;That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3&quot; can be shortened to
        &quot;1 + 1 is 2, not 3.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone
        says, not a weaker one that&#39;s easier to criticize.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eschew flamebait. Don&#39;t introduce flamewar topics unless you have
        something genuinely new to say. Avoid unrelated controversies and
        generic tangents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please don&#39;t insinuate that someone hasn&#39;t read an article.
        &quot;Did you even read the article? It mentions that&quot; can be
        shortened to &quot;The article mentions that.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Please don&#39;t use uppercase for emphasis. If you want to emphasize a
        word or phrase, put *asterisks* around it and it will get italicized.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please don&#39;t accuse others of astroturfing or shillage. Email us
        instead and we&#39;ll look into it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please don&#39;t complain that a submission is inappropriate. If a story
        is spam or off-topic, flag it. Don&#39;t feed egregious comments by
        replying; <a href="/newsfaq#cflag">flag</a> them instead. When you flag
        something, please don&#39;t also comment that you did.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please don&#39;t comment about the voting on comments. It never does any
        good, and it makes boring reading.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throwaway accounts are ok for sensitive information, but please
        don&#39;t create them routinely. On HN, users need an identity that
        others can relate to.
      </p>
      <p>
        We ban accounts that use Hacker News primarily for political or
        ideological battle, regardless of which politics they favor.
