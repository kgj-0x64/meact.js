      <b>Hacker News FAQ</b>
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Are there rules about submissions and comments?</b>
      <p>
        <a href="/newsguidelines">
          https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>How are stories ranked?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic algorithm divides points by a power of the time since a story
        was submitted. Comments in comment threads are ranked the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other factors affecting rank include user flags, anti-abuse software,
        software which downweights overheated discussions, and moderator
        intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>How is a user&#39;s karma calculated?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Roughly, the number of upvotes on their stories and comments minus the
        number of downvotes. The numbers don&#39;t match up exactly, because
        some votes aren&#39;t counted to prevent abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Why don&#39;t I see down arrows?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no down arrows on stories. They appear on comments after users
        reach a certain karma threshold, but never on direct replies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What kind of formatting can you use in comments?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="/formatdoc">http://news.ycombinator.com/formatdoc</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>How do I submit a question?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Use the submit link in the top bar, and leave the url field blank.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How do I make a link in a question?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can&#39;t. This is to prevent people from submitting a link with
        their comments in a privileged position at the top of the page. If you
        want to submit a link with comments, just submit it, then add a regular
        comment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b id="cflag">How do I flag a comment?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Click on its timestamp to go to its page, then click the &#39;flag&#39;
        link at the top. There&#39;s a small karma threshold before flag links
        appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Are reposts ok?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If a story has had significant attention in the last year or so, we kill
        reposts as duplicates. If not, a small number of reposts is ok.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please don&#39;t delete and repost the same story, though. Accounts that
        do that eventually lose submission privileges.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Are paywalls ok?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        It&#39;s ok to post stories from sites with paywalls that have
        workarounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        In comments, it&#39;s ok to ask how to read an article and to help other
        users do so. But please don&#39;t post complaints about paywalls. Those
        are off topic.
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>
        <b>Can I ask people to upvote my submission?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        No. Users should vote for a story because it&#39;s intellectually
        interesting, not because someone is promoting it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the software detects a voting ring, it penalizes the post. Accounts
        that vote like this eventually get their votes ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Can I post a job ad?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Please do not post job ads as story submissions to HN.</p>
      <p>
        A regular &quot;Who Is Hiring?&quot; thread appears on the first weekday
        of each month. Most job ads are welcome there. (But only an account
        called <a href="/submitted?id=whoishiring">whoishiring</a> is allowed to
        submit the thread itself. This prevents a race to post it first.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The other kind of job ad is reserved for YC-funded startups. These
        appear on the front page, but are not stories: they have no vote arrows,
        points, or comments. They begin part-way down, then fall steadily, and
        only one should be on the front page at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Why can&#39;t I post a comment to a thread?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Threads are closed to new comments after two weeks, or if the submission
        has been killed by software, moderators, or user flags.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>In my profile, what does showdead do?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you turn it on, you&#39;ll see all the stories and comments that have
        been killed by HN&#39;s software, moderators, and user flags.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>In my profile, what is delay?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        It gives you time to edit your comments before they appear to others.
        Set it to the number of minutes you&#39;d like. The maximum is 10.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>In my profile, what is noprocrast?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        It&#39;s a way to help you prevent yourself from spending too much time
        on HN. If you turn it on you&#39;ll only be allowed to visit the site
        for maxvisit minutes at a time, with gaps of minaway minutes in between.
        The defaults are 20 and 180, which would let you view the site for 20
        minutes at a time, and then not allow you back in for 3 hours. You can
        override noprocrast if you want, in which case your visit clock starts
        over at zero.

        <b>How do I submit a poll?</b>

        <b>How do I reset my password?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have an email address in your profile, you can request a password
        reset <a href="/forgot?id=">here</a>. If you haven&#39;t, you can create
        a new account or email hn@ycombinator.com for help.

        <b>My IP address seems to be banned. How can I unban it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you request many pages too quickly, your IP address might get banned.
        The <a href="/item?id=4761102">self-serve unbanning procedure</a> works
        most of the time.
